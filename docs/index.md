# OpenRoadSim: An Open-Source Automotive Simulation Framework

Welcome to **OpenRoadSim**, a powerful and extensible open-source simulation framework designed for the **integrated validation of automotive infotainment systems and signal-level domains**.

Engineered for accessibility, modularity, and real-world applicability, OpenRoadSim empowers developers to simulate and rigorously test **cross-domain vehicle interactions** — directly on a standard laptop, without the need for expensive HIL test benches.

## Features and Supported Domains

OpenRoadSim supports simulation and orchestration of:

- **GPS navigation**
- **CAN bus communication**
- **Multimedia playback**
- **Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS)**
- **Voice interaction**
- **Custom plugins** for user-defined behaviors
