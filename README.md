# OpenRoadSim

**OpenRoadSim** is a proposed open-source simulation framework for integrated validation of automotive infotainment systems and signal-level domains. Built for accessibility and extensibility, OpenRoadSim enables developers to simulate and test complex, cross-domain vehicle interactionsâ€”including GPS, CAN bus, media playback, ADAS, and voice interactionâ€”on standard laptops.

## Overview

Modern vehicles rely heavily on software for features ranging from navigation to driver assistance. However, validating these systems often requires expensive, closed, and fragmented simulation platforms.

**OpenRoadSim** addresses this challenge by providing:
- A **modular, plugin-based architecture**
- A graphical IDE called **SimStudio**
- A human-readable **scenario scripting language**
- **LLM integration** for AI-assisted scenario creation
- Optional support for **real hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)** testing

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Plugin System**: Each subsystem (e.g., CAN, GPS, ADAS) runs as an independent plugin.
-  **AI Support**: Natural language scenario generation using large language models.
-  **SimStudio IDE**: Visual timeline editor, signal viewer, live log console.
-  **Scenario Scripting**: YAML-based scenarios with timing, conditions, and loops.
-  **Hardware Integration**: Supports USB-CAN, GPS dongles, Android IVI devices.
-  **Community Ready**: Built for collaboration, customization, and open contribution.
